# Example code for the class CSC 485, "Testing for Developers"

## Basic Design

Every homework assignment will involve application code to be tested, and the test code.

The assignment's application code goes in a python package (folder + _ _ init_ _.py file) under the "projects" folder.

The assignment's test code goes in a same-named folder under the "tests" folder.


## Running Code Coverage
In order to run coverage against your project, you need to:
1. install it using ````pip install -U coverage```` from the command line
2. get the version from a ````pip freeze```` command
3. make sure you are in a new local branch!
4. add a line to requirements.txt with the coverage version
5. update your setup.cfg with the following new sections:
````yaml
[coverage:run]
# provide data on branch coverage
branch = True

# ignore the empty __init__.py files
omit = */__init__.py

# just look at the "application" code, not the test code
# this requires that you run your code from your *project* folder
source = suny485/projects

[coverage:report]
exclude_also =
    # don't complain about non-runnable code
    if __name__ == .__main__.:
````

Once code coverage is installed and configured, you can generate your coverage report by running these commands:
````commandline
# use the coverage CLI tool to run pytest
coverage run -m pytest -v --tb=short

# when the tests finish, run the report
coverage report -m

# you should get output that looks like this:
